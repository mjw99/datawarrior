/**
 * This interface provides access to a JPanel that displays a chemical (sub-)structure,
 * which may be edited to define a chemical search (sub-structure, similarity, exact, ...).
 * The panel is meant to be used within the plugin dialog.
 * The editor's behaviour can be toggled between molecule and fragment logic.
 * In molecule mode open valences are understood as being filled with implicit hydrogens,
 * which are not shown on carbon atoms, but shown on hetero atoms.
 * In fragment mode the drawn chemical moiety is considered to be a sub-structure fragment
 * with unoccupied valences understood to be open and with the ability to defined atom-
 * and bond-specific query features.<br>
 * An IChemistryPanel is garanteed to be derived from JPanel and, thus, can be embedded into
 * any Swing based containers.
